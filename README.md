## ðŸ“Œ API Routes (Sample)

- `POST /auth/register` â€“ Register user
- `POST /auth/login` â€“ Login user
- `GET /tasks` â€“ Fetch tasks
- `POST /tasks` â€“ Create new task
- `PUT /tasks/:id` â€“ Update task

- Notifications are in-app only (no email/SMS).
- MongoDB was chosen for flexibility in data modeling.
- Minimal styling done with Tailwind CSS for speed.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add Gantt chart/calendar views
- Email notifications
- Export tasks (CSV, PDF)
- Mobile app version (React Native)
